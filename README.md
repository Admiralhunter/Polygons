# Polygons

This project was a task given to me for a job skill assesmment during an interview process. The task was to be given a group of .txt files with each line specifying a line segment. I was to then draw the line segments, determine if the resulting shape is a single closed polygon and then if it was, calculate the area.

This program checks a folder directory and loops through all the .txt files within the folder. For each file it will read the data and if the data is structured correctly, it will do the rest of the task.

The program will scale and shift the data to ensure that the shape fits within a 1000 by 1000 frame.
